This is an exercise made for learning JavaScript skills.

In this exercise we create a web site where you can search for anime series and filter them with a "search" button

You can also pick your favorite ones and make a list on the left side of the webpage. These favorite series will be stored in local storage.

There is a reset button for you to erase the results, your favorites and the list of favorites saved in your local storage.

To run the web page, enter "npm start" or "npm run dev" in your Terminal.
